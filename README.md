# Data-Science-Capstone-Project

## Introduction
This is the capstone project for the Coursera Data Science Specialization, taught by professors from John Hopkins University and is in collaboration with Swiftkey, a text prediction app company. The project is a text prediction shiny application which identifies three words most likely of being the next word of a user specified incomplete sentence. The algorithm uses the n-gram backoff model concept.

## Data

The data sets I had to work with as part of this project were three text files containing english twitter, blog and news data.
